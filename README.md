Sentiment analysis on the social web examines the sentiment, moods and opinions
of their users. Due to the growing popularity of social networks in recent years, the
importance of their analysis is increasing, in order to improve marketing, customer care or
to find out the general opinion about a certain person. In this work, we focused on specific
content elements, namely emoticons, which appear very often in the posts. We examined
their importance and impact on the success of sentiment classification.


We designed and created a method classifying posts into selected classes using emoticons. We tried several algorithms with multiple word and emoticon processing techniques.
The method was verified by data from the english and slovak social networks. In addition, we performed a qualitative analysis of emoticons, from which we obtained useful
information.


Evaluation confirmed the hypothesis that usage of emoticons will significantly improves the success of the presented method. We also found out, that hybrid approach
(combination of a lexicon and a machine learning approach) improves the success of the
method by up to 12%.
